              <li>improving our car parking facilities to ensure safety of all members due to the increase in traffic entering the centre.</li>
              <li>Creating a viewing area which will further enhance the social aspect to our club by enabling spectators to watch games and enjoy the facilities.</li>
              <li>Upgrading of lighting and heating in the Squash Courts</li>
            <p>As a progressive club we are now fundraising to make this a reality. In November 2019 we were awarded â‚¬56,000 in Sports Capital Funding which was a great boost and encouragement to our plans and fundraising objectives.</p>
